# Project descripton

 Developed a sentiment analysis web application leveraging Python, Flask, Docker, Gunicorn, and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The application accepts user input through a web interface, analyzes the sentiment of the text using a pre-trained model, and returns the result as either "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE". Containerized the application using Docker and Gunicorn for simplified deployment and improved scalability.

Key tools and technologies used:

Python: Programming language used for implementing the application logic and sentiment analysis model.
Flask: Lightweight web framework for creating the web application and handling user input.
Docker: Containerization platform to package the application and its dependencies for easy deployment and scalability.
Gunicorn: WSGI HTTP server to serve the Flask application within the Docker container.
Hugging Face Transformers: Machine learning library utilized for sentiment analysis using a pre-trained model.
The project demonstrates proficiency in web application development, containerization, and the application of machine learning models using popular tools and libraries.
